					<div class="spacer"></div><div class="spacer"></div><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">The Day of the Programmer is an international professional day recognized in many technology companies and programming firms that is celebrated on the 256th (hexadecimal 100th, or two to the eighth power) day of each year (September 13 during common years and on September 12 in leap years).</p>
	 <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">The number 256 was chosen because it is the number of distinct values that can be represented with an eight-bit byte, a value well-known to programmers. 256 is also the highest power of two that is less than 365, the number of days in a common year.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">Applied Programming Dept staff congratulates you â€“ students of the department, future programmers, in this festive day and wishes inspiration, so that your creations had fewer errors, and thankful users of your software masterpieces would always generously pay for your work!</p>
